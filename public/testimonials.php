					<blockquote class="quote">Lovely spot with excellent coffee, so my boyfriend tells me. I just come for the cake and little lemony things that look like baby croissants? Yep. Don't eat one or you'll never stop and there's loads of flavours. Cute place, friendly staff. Recommend.<br /><br />

					<blockquote class="quote">The most important thing about Hitchin Coffee Lab is this - the coffee is fantastic. In addition, the staff are lovely; welcoming us and our tiny baby, helping us with the pram, and generally being lovely and nice. We can't wait to go back.<br /><br />
